Hi! My name's Audrey Xie and I'm an undergraduate student at MIT studying both math and computer science.

I am currently part of Professor Jonathan Ragan-Kelley's group at CSAIL where I develop gradient-based methods for hyperparameter optimization. I am also a tutor at the [Math Learning Center](https://math.mit.edu/learningcenter/) and play the liuqin for the MIT Chinese music ensemble.
