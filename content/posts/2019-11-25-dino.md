I wanted to make a pixel-by-pixel replica of the original dino game that ran in command-prompt. The idea was for each pixel to be represented with a unicode block element, but then I realized that the dinosaur would take up a big chunk of the screen. Instead, I simplified the artwork even more while trying to maintain the general "idea". I think it looks pretty good, but you can decide for yourself by taking a look at the final product [here](https://github.com/0aax/dino).
