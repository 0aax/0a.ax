I built a CLI mood tracker that judges your mood based on which version of IHTFP you choose. IHTFP is quite the versatile acronym. On bad days, it stands for "I Hate This Fucking Place." On better days it can mean "I Have Truly Found Paradise." You can find it [here](https://github.com/0aax/ihtfp).
