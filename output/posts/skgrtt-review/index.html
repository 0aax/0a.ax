			<h1>skGRTT's first review</h1>
			<p>It has been more than two years since I published <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aud-xie.skGRTT">skGRTT</a>, a red VSCode editor theme. Recently, it received its very first review!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Been through numerous red themes but none were my type, except this one :p ...perfect combination of red colors. I love this theme. â™¥"</p>

<p>Getting this notification made me inexplicably happy!</p>
