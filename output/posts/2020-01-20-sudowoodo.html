			<h1>Sudowoodo reminding you to be careful when using sudo</h1>
			<p>Remember the lecture that you received when you first used sudo?</p>

<pre class="synNormal">
We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System Administrator.
It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
</pre>

<p>It's a pretty nice warning, unfortunately, it only appears once. You can edit the sudoers file to make it permanent. Open the fine by running <code>sudo visudo</code> and then modify it to have the following line.</p>

<pre class="synNormal">
Defaults    lecture=always
</pre>

<p>You can also set a custom lecture, for instance, an <a href="https://github.com/0aax/sudowoodo/blob/master/sudoers.lecture">ascii image of sudowoodo</a>. Create a new file with the message to be displayed and set <code>lecture_file</code> to wherever the file is (e.g. <code>/etc/sudoers.lecture</code>).</p>

<pre class="synNormal">
# (replace the path with your own)
Defaults    lecture_file=/etc/sudoers.lecture
</pre>
